# Vido
Video but shorter

## Our vision
All videos are now consumable! We no longer live in an era were 
we must spend multiple continuous minutes watching videos. Videos are now 
accessible at the length you desire. Imagine opening youtube, and seeing a 
30 minute video, well now imagine watching a 5 minute professionally 
summarized version containing only the most important sentences.
Welcome to the future.

## Setup
You will need to install ffmpeg. We are using the ffmpeg python bindings in the ffmpeg-python library. 
```
pip install ffmpeg-python
```

You will also need to install the ffmpeg executable from [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
You will need to set up this executable as a system variable in order for everything to work properly.

In windows add the path to the Path system variable.
