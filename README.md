Video but shorter

## Setup
You will need to install ffmpeg. We are using the ffmpeg python bindings in the ffmpeg-python library. 
```
pip install ffmpeg-python
```

You will also need to install the ffmpeg executable from [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
You will need to set up this executable as a system variable in order for everything to work properly.

In windows add the path to the Path system variable.
In linux for mac you need to create an alias.
